From the paper for RL:
    Algorithm used: A3C
    #Actors: 12
    Training config: multiple CARLA servers (a total of 12, 4 GPUs, 3 instances each) (https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/25)
    # Steps: 10 million
    Time Taken: 12days
    FPS: 10
    Initial Learning Rate: 7e^-4 (decayed to zero)
    Input Image: 84 × 84 passed through 3 layer CNN (Mnih)
    Input also has vecotors (The measurement vector includes the current speed of the car, distance to goal, damage from collisions,
            and the current high-level command provided by the topological planner, in one-hot encoding)
    Input Processing: The inputs are processed by two separate modules:
            images by a convolutional module, measurements by a fully-connected network.
            The outputs of the two modules are concatenated and further processed jointly
    Rollouts (Batch size): 20
    Entropy Regularization: 0.01
    Reward function: The reward is a weighted sum of five terms: distance traveled towards the goal d in km, speed v in km/h, collision damage c,
            intersection with the sidewalk s (between 0 and 1), and intersection with the opposite lane o (between 0 and 1).
